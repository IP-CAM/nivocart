ADVANCED SHOPPING CART SYSTEM

NivoCart is a fully featured shopping cart solution written in pure PHP, Html5, CSS3 and jQuery.<br />
NivoCart is completely self-contained (no remote dependencies) and does NOT use any frameworks such as Bootstrap, or template engines such as Twig. It uses the simple yet very efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" title="MVC">MVC</a> + L (Model-View-Controller + Language) file structure, for both the backend administration and the store(s) frontend.<br />
NivoCart is primarily designed for small and medium online business entrepreneurs, presenting them with an easy to use and reliable all-in-one shopping cart application to strengthen their online presence. The second objective of NivoCart is to give developers and web-design agencies a strong platform to work with, for the benefit of their respective customers.<br />
NivoCart is a community based project where everybody is welcome. Feel free to download it, clone it, test it and contribute to it. Help and support can be found by visiting the <a href="http://forum.nivocart.com" title="Forum">NivoCart Community Forums</a>.
