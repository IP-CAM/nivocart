ADVANCED SHOPPING CART SYSTEM

NivoCart is a fully featured shopping cart solution written in pure PHP, Html5, CSS3 and jQuery. It is a user friendly all-in-one application developed for small or medium businesses wanting to have a strong and secure online presence.<br />
NivoCart is completely self-contained, does not have any remote dependencies and does not use any frameworks or template engines. It is built using the simple yet very effective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" title="MVC">MVC</a>+L (Model-View-Controller + Language) architecture, for both the backend administration and the store(s) frontend.<br />
NivoCart is a community based project, so feel free to download it, clone it, test it and contribute to it.<br />
Help and support can be found by visiting the <a href="http://forum.nivocart.com" title="Forum">NivoCart Community Forums</a>.

Same as the above INSTALLATION guidelines, but without steps 5 and 6:
